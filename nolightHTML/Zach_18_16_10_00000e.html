Pages you view in incognito tabs won't stick around in your browser's history, cookie store, or search history after you've         closed all your incognito tabs. Any files you download or bookmarks you create will be kept.

However, you aren't invisible. Going incognito doesn't hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the     websites you visit.
